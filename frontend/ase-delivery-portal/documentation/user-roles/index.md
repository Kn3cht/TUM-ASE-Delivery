# User Roles

Users are assigned a role on creation. Possible roles are:
- [DISPATCHER](#dispatcher)
- [CUSTOMER](#customer)
- [DELIVERER](#deliverer)



## Customer

Customers are the recipients of deliveries. The frontend allows customers to track their deliveries.

## Dispatcher

Dispatchers have full management capabilities and have crud permissions on all connected services.

## Deliverer

Deliverers will deliver deliveries to pre-defined pick up boxes where clients can then collect them.
They have only permission to see deliveries and boxes that are assigned to them.
Customer details are completely hidden.
